# Social Network API

## Description
This is a fully functional (well... almost fully functional) back-end for a hypothetical social media site. Users may create new users, as well as view all of the users, update users, and delete users. This application uses mongoose to store data. Though it can be confusing, it offers more flexability than your standard SQL database which can be a big advantage for web developers. For a breakdown on how to run this app, please see the walkthrough video below. 

The world of web development is ever changing: always a new technology on the horizon. Developers sometimes must learn new technologies quickly in order to implement them in a project. This is a skill that I am still practicing at, and this project has brought me closer to that goal. Thanks for reading, and happy coding.
